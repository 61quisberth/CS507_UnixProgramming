{
The {\em Simple Sockets Library} (\SSL) allows~C~programmers to use
interprocess communications via Berkeley sockets simply and quickly.
The programmer is able to move information easily between processes
on the same or different machines connected via Ethernet \TradeMark and using
the \TCP\ protocol.  Most of the \SSL's functions resemble C's file i/o
functions, so~C~programmers will find the {\SSL} easy to learn.

The {\SSL} currently runs under various {\small UNIX \TradeMark} machines:
{\small IRIX \TradeMark} (Silicon Graphics), SunOS \TradeMark (Sun), Domain O/S
\TradeMark (Apollo), Ultrix \TradeMark (Dec), {\small AIX \TradeMark} ({\small
IBM}), {\small SCO \TradeMark}, {\small OSF \TradeMark}, and {\small VMS} 5.x
\TradeMark, and {\small MS-DOS \TradeMark} (using Borland C++ 5.0).

\section{Introduction}

The {\em Simple Sockets Library} (henceforth to be abbreviated as the \SSL)
allows~C~programmers to develop systems of cooperating programs using Berkeley
streaming Sockets running under the {\TCP} protocol over Ethernet.  The
{\SSL} provides simple ways to move information between programs running on the
same or different machines and does so with little overhead.  During
experiments with the {\em Sreadbytes} and {\em Swrite} functions, for example,
between two machines,~a~$44,000$ bytes/second transfer rate was achieved with
4~bytes per packet and over $1,000,000$ bytes/second was achieved with
128~bytes per packet.  Of course, heavily loaded networks will affect the rate
individual users achieve.  The {\SSL} provides {\em two-way} communications.

The {\SSL} was designed to resemble the {\small FILE} i/o system provided
by the standard~C~libraries (ie.~fopen, fclose, fputs, etc. map to
{\SSL} analogs Sopen, Sclose, Sputs, etc.).  Thus,~C~programmers typically
find the {\SSL} easy to learn.

A~good analogy for the {\SSL} refers to the phone system.  There are three types
of Sockets supported by the {\SSL} that concern the user:~a~{\em server},~a~{\em
client}, and an {\em accept} socket. ~A~server is analogous to someone waiting
by several phones for~a~call,~a~client is analogous to someone making~a~call,
and an accept is analogous to~a~(server) person accepting the call by picking
up one of the phones.

Thus, one must have~a~server for~a~client to make~a~successful connection.  The
server must in turn accept the connection.  Unlike our overworked server
person, however, the computer using the {\SSL} is perfectly happy handling
multiple ``accept'' Sockets concurrently.

The {\SSL} itself is provided in three main parts (see Table~\ref{three-parts}).
The {\em Library} is composed of~C~functions and the {\em PortMaster} and the
{\em Utilities} are self-contained programs.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \caption{\bf The Three Parts of the \SSL}
  \label{three-parts}
  \begin{description}

  \item[Library] The functions that the users will link to are in the
    library.

  \item[PortMaster] The PortMaster is~a~d\"aemon program which runs in
    the background.  It allows {\em clients} to connect to {\em servers}
    using any available ports.

  \item[Utilities] There are several utility programs provided with
    the \SSL: {\tt sktdbg}, {\tt srmsrvr}, and {\tt spmtable}.
  \end{description}
\end{table}

The {\SSL} was used at the
Intelligent Robotics Laboratory (\IRL) since May, 1991.  The software appears
to be stable at the current writing and reasonably robust.  For example, the
PortMaster,~a~background process provided in the {\SSL} distribution, is
resistant to hanging (and thereby being unresponsive). It uses {\em
Stimeoutwait\/}s (see the Reference Manual) to return to its normal quiescent
mode when communications with one of its clients ceases unexpectedly.

The \IRL\ uses the {\SSL} to control its three robots; its use of the Ethernet
is consequently somewhat heavy.  Those of you who wish to control machinery or
otherwise present~a~heavy load may wish to purchase~a~``bridge'' to isolate
your machines from your local network.  This isolation will benefit both the
you and the network, as the heavy user will not be afflicted with slowdowns due
to the network and the network will not be bothered with lots of packets which
slows all its users down.


\newpage
\section{The Library}

The user of the {\SSL} accesses it by linking his or her program to~a~{\em
library}. ~A~software library is typically~a~single file which consists of some
linkage information along with pre-compiled {\em object code}; unfortunately,
methods for producing~a~library and linking to it vary from system to system
and compiler to compiler.  Directions for several systems appear in the Section
on Implementation.

Practically speaking,~a~library is composed of~a~number of pre-compiled C
functions to be utilized by the programmer.  The calls made available in the
{\SSL} are reminiscent of those used by the various file functions in the C
language (see Table~\ref{reminiscent}).

\begin{table}[thb]

  \caption{Simple Sockets and Related File {\protect\small I/O} Functions}

  {\em File Function} & {\em Socket Function}     \\ \hline

  fgets               & Sgets                     \\
  fputs               & Sputs                     \\
  fprintf             & Sprintf                   \\

  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

The Sockets library depends upon the {\em PortMaster} running on your host
machine. Only one copy of the PortMaster need be running at any time on~a~given
machine, and may be started up by anyone by running the {\em Spm} program in
the background.  On Unix, the {\em Spm} program will put itself into the
background.  One may determine if your system has~a~PortMaster running by
typing {\em spmtable} first -- it will inform you of any existing servers if
the PortMaster is up or tell you that the PortMaster is not up otherwise.

A~new feature of the {\SSL} allows servers to share another machine's PortMaster.
Thus, the {\SSL} supports both distributed and centralized socket name to port
mapping.  If the machine on which~a~server is to run doesn't have~a~PortMaster,
such as older {\small MSDOS} machines, then it can ``borrow'' another machine's
PortMaster.

A~program may open~a~server Socket,~a~client Socket, or an accept Socket.
Following the phone system analogy, assume that~a~server Socket is opened
first.  Then,~a~different program may open~a~client Socket which attempts to
connect to the server -- it succeeds when the server program ``notices'' that
there is~a~connection waiting on the server Socket and then generates an accept
Socket.  The client Socket can open, however, before the server accepts the
client; there just won't be any two-way communication until the server does
accept the client.

\subsection{User Guide}

Software using~C~must \verb`#include "sockets.h"` and must link to the \SSL.
Directions for doing so will vary from system to system and also depend upon
where the installer placed the libraries.  Please refer to your compiler
documentation and the {\SSL} installer to know how to set up library linkage
paths and for the include path to the {\em sockets.h} file.

The software below illustrates some typical Socket code fragments to get a
connected socket, assuming that the \verb`sockets.h` file is on your compiler's
include search path.  If the \verb`sockets.h` file has been placed in a
standard system directory (not wise - updates to the compiler may wipe it off!)
then you may have to substitute \verb`#include <sockets.h>` for \verb`#include` 
"sockets.h"` in the following examples.

\begin{example}~A~server with one accept     \\ \label{one-accept}
 \begin{verbatim}
    #include "sockets.h"
    Socket *server;
    Socket *skt;
    server= Sopen("servername","s");
    skt   = Saccept(server);
    ...
    Sclose(skt);
    Sclose(server);
 \end{verbatim}
\end{example}

Note in Example~\ref{one-accept} that the servername is completely up to the
programmer to select.  Please note that all servers share the same namespace on
any given machine, however.

\begin{example}~A~server with multiple accepts \\ \label{multi-accept}
 \begin{verbatim}
    #include "sockets.h"
    Socket *server=NULL;
    Socket *skt=NULL;
    server= Sopen("servername","s");
    do {
      skt= Saccept(server);
      ...
      Sclose(skt);
      } while(whatever);
    Sclose(server);
 \end{verbatim}
\end{example}

Again, the programmer may select any servername.  Note that the {\em accept}
Socket (``skt'') is re-used in Example~\ref{multi-accept}.  Actually, coding
of multiple accept sockets is usually a bit more involved; see  \verb`multiskt.c`
in the {\small EXAMPLES} directory.  I usually set up a doubly-linked list
containing a Socket pointer for each such accepted client and put them
on the mask (using \verb`Smaskset()`).  I can then use \verb`Smaskwait()` or
\verb`Smasktimeoutwait()` to wait for any Socket, including the server itself,
that needs attention.  Upon closing such a Socket, I also use  \verb`Smaskunset()`
to remove it from the mask and do a double-link deletion.

\begin{example}~A~client                    \\ \label{client}
 \begin{verbatim}
    #include "sockets.h"
    Socket *client;
    while(1) {
      client= Sopen("serverName","c");
      if(client) break;
      sleep(1);
      }
    ...
    Sclose(client);
 \end{verbatim}
\end{example}

In Example~\ref{client}, the \verb`serverName` may be in the optional form
\verb`serverName@machineName`.  Without the machine name specification, the
PortMaster on the machine that the client is running on will be searched for
the server.  The \verb`smsrvr.c` and \verb`smclient.c` example programs provided
in the {\SSL} distribution give complete illustrations of Examples~\ref{one-accept}
and \ref{client}.

Note that the Sopen() of a client will fail if the server is not already up; in
which case, a null pointer is returned.  Example~\ref{client} illustrates a
probing method (in this case, once a second).  Example~\ref{blockingclient}
shows an option to have Sopen() block until the requested server is available.

\begin{example}~A~blocking~until~open~client \\ \label{blockingclient}
 \begin{verbatim}
    #include "sockets.h"
    Socket *client;
    client= Sopen("serverName","b");
    ...
    Sclose(client);
 \end{verbatim}
\end{example}

In Example~\ref{blockingclient}, the requested server may or may not be up already.
If the server is available, a normal client connection is opened.  If the server
is {\it not} available, then the client will block (wait) until the server
is brought up.  Internally, the PortMaster places any clients that open using
this option on a waiting list when the server is not available.  When the server
connects to the PortMaster, the PortMaster then checks its waiting list for
clients who wish to connect.

\begin{example} Using Sopenv                                 \\ \label{using-sopenv}
 \begin{verbatim}
    #include "sockets.h"
    Socket *client;
    while(1) {
      client= Sopenv("serverName","c","SKTPATH");
      if(client) break;
      sleep(1);
      }
    ...
    Sclose(client);
 \end{verbatim}
\end{example}

The {\SSL} allows the programmer to set up~a~group of machines for making client
connections.  In Example~\ref{using-sopenv}, the {\SSL} tries to open~a~client
to~a~server named \verb`serverName` on any machine on the {\small SKTPATH}.
The ``{\small SKTPATH}'' is an environment variable typically of the form
\verb`machine1:machine2:machine3`, ie.~a list of machine names separated by
colons.  This example also shows~a~typical client connection attempt and sleep
polling loop.

A~somewhat larger example is included in the distribution: \verb`multiskt.c`.
This example program concurrently accepts multiple clients on~a~single server,
reads any messages sent its way from any of its clients, and sends~a~modified
version back to the sending client.  It uses the {\em Smaskwait} functions to
block the multiskt process for friendly multi-tasking.  It is~a~useful program
to study in conjunction with the Manual below.

Connected sockets are~a~pre-requisite for any of the {\small I/O} Socket
functions described in the next section.  Note that the server should have a
unique name on any given machine. Servers may have the same name on different
machines, although this may be confusing.  It is suggested that one use the
name of the process (at least as~a~prefix) for that purpose.  Note that the
only things that one can do with~a~server Socket are: open one, close one,
generate an accept Socket with one, and test/block on one (for clients
requesting connection).  The {\SSL} supports up to $10$ clients concurrently
awaiting acceptance on~a~server Socket, although many machines will limit
that to $5$ (silently).

The {\SSL} supports two way communication of data between~a~client and an accept
Socket.  Since the processes are not likely to be synchronized, often one
process must somehow wait until the other process has sent it something.  There
are two methods to support this under the \SSL: polling and interrupt-driven.
The polling method uses~a~lot of {\small CPU} time, but lets the program do
other tasks in the meantime.  The interrupt-driven approach hangs the process
(aka blocks and suspends) until something shows up on the Socket.  The
Smask{\small XXX} group of functions allows one to hang the process until
something shows up on any number of Sockets -- sort of~a~big {\small OR} gate!

The Smask{\small XXX} alternative to polling also allows the programmer to
insert non-socket file descriptors into the mask via Smaskfdset (and to remove
them via Smaskunfdset) such as serial ports (ex. open with DEVICE), graphics queues
(ex. {\small SGI}s with qgetfd), etc.


\subsection{Reference Manual}

This section contains~a~description of the functions available in the Socket
Library.  The {\SSL} returns three types of Sockets:~a~server, client, and an
accept Socket. ~A~Socket itself is~a~data structure {\em type} set up by the
\verb`sockets.h` header file.  The Socket is deliberately used in~a~fashion
reminiscent of the use of {\small FILE} pointers so that the~C~user who knows
how to read and write~a~file will immediately feel comfortable with reading and
writing Sockets.

\begin{description}

\item[Socket *Saccept(Socket *skt)] \     This function takes~a~server Socket and produces~a~Socket which has
    accepted~a~connection.  This function may be used as often as wanted on the
    same server Socket!  Note that one must have successfully opened~a~server
    prior to using Saccept to accept connections (see Examples~\ref{one-accept}
    and \ref{multi-accept}).

    If this operation is unsuccessful, then Saccept will return~a~null Socket
    pointer.

\item[void Sclose(Socket *skt)] \     This function closes~a~Socket of any type (server, client, accept).  The
    Sclose function communicates with the local PortMaster whenever~a~server is
    closed.

\item[char *Sgets(char *buf, int maxbuf, Socket *skt)] \     This is an I/O function which assumes that one has already opened a
    connected Socket ({\em skt}).  It will attempt to get~a~null-terminated
    string from the Socket (up to maxbuf characters).  This call will block
    (aka hang, sleep) until~a~string shows up, but otherwise acts much as a
    fgets() function does.

    If Sgets has~a~socket error, then~a~null pointer is returned.  Otherwise,
    it returns the ``{\em buf}'' pointer.

\item[int Smaskfdisset(int fd)] \     The Smaskfdisset() function works in conjunction with the Smaskwait()
    function.  After the Smaskwait() function returns, one can use
    Smaskfdisset(skt) to test if~a~particular file descriptor is read-ready.

\item[void Smaskfdset(int fd)] \     The Smask{\small XXX} functions use~a~{\it mask} of type {\it fd\_set}
    internally.  Other operations, such as use of~a~serial port under
    Unix or the {\small\it GL} queue for {\small SGI}'s Irises (see their
    qgetfd() function) use file descriptors.  This function allows one to
    set up the Smask{\small XXX} mask with one or more of those file
    descriptors.

\item[Smask Smaskget()] \     The Smask{\small XXX} functions use~a~{\it mask} of type {\it fd\_set}
    internally.  Other operations, such as use of~a~serial port under
    Unix, can also be used to set masks.  This function provides access to
    the mask set up by Smaskset.  The mate to this function is Smaskuse().

\item[int Smaskisset(Socket *skt)] \     The Smaskisset() function works in conjunction with the Smaskwait()
    function.  After the Smaskwait() function returns, one can use
    Smaskisset(skt) to test if~a~particular Socket is read-ready.  It is
    simpler then and thereby faster than Smasktest().

\item[void Smaskpop()] \     The Smaskpop() function, along with the Smaskpush() function, allows
    the programmer to manipulate an internal stack of masks.  The ``top''
    mask is the current mask.

\item[void Smaskpush()] \     The Smaskpush() function, along with the Smaskpop() function, allows
    the programmer to manipulate an internal stack of masks.  The ``top''
    mask is the current mask.

\item[void Smaskset(Socket *skt)] \     This function is part of the {\em Smask{\small XXX}} group.  Sockets may be
    set up for Smaskwait'ing one at~a~time.   Note that all Sockets are
    effectively {\small OR}'ed together for blocking; to clear the mask, pass a
    {\small NULL} Socket pointer to Smaskset:  Smaskset((Socket *) {\small
    NULL});.

\item[int Smasktest()] \     This function is part of the {\em Smask{\small XXX}} group.  The Smasktest
    function supports polling -- one may determine if anything is on any of the
    Smaskset Sockets and immediately receive~a~positive integer if there is,
   ~a~0 if there isn't, and~a~negative number if there's an error.

\item[void Smasktime(long seconds,long useconds)] \     This function is part of the {\em Smask{\small XXX}} group.
    Normally Smaskwait will block ``forever'' (well, at least as long as
    the machine stays up!).  However, one can specify~a~time limit -- then
    Smaskwait will return with~a~value of 0 if the time limit is exceeded.  One
    may specify the time limit in seconds and micro-seconds.  To clear the time
    limit (ie.~restore Smaskwait to waiting forever), pass~a~negative time in
    either or both arguments to Smasktime.  Waiting forever is also set up when
    both arguments to Smasktime are zero.

\item[void Smaskunfdset(int fd)] \     This function is part of the {\em Smask{\small XXX}} group.
    File descriptors may be entered into the mask via the Smaskfdset()
    function, and this function can remove it from the mask.  This function
    is similar to the Smaskunset() function.

\item[void Smaskunset(Socket *skt)] \     This function is part of the {\em Smask{\small XXX}} group.  Sockets may be
    removed from the Smaskwait's mask one at~a~time via this function.  Like
    {\em Smaskset},~a~{\em Smaskunset((Socket *) {\small NULL});} will clear
    the entire mask.

\item[void Smaskuse(Smask usermask)] \     This function is part of the {\em Smask{\small XXX}} group.  The internal
    {\em mask} in Smask{\small XXX} can be set up by the user via this
    function.  Often, Smaskset will be used to set up an internal mask,
    Smaskget will be used to obtain the resulting mask, and Smaskuse will
    be used to apply that mask.

\item[int Smaskwait()] \     This function is part of the {\em Smask{\small XXX}} group.  The {\em
    Smaskwait}  function will block (aka hang) the process until any Socket set
    via Smaskset has something waiting on it to be read.  Note that Sockets set
    by Smaskset are retained; ie.~they must be explicitly cleared by passing a
    {\small NULL} Socket pointer to Smaskset.

    Smaskwait returns~a~positive number if something is waiting on a
    Socket, zero if~a~timeout occurs, and~a~negative number on an error.

\item[Socket *Sopen(char *skthost, char *mode)] \     This function is the workhorse for opening Sockets.  Basically, it can make
    either~a~server or~a~client depending on the mode.

      \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{|cl|}
      \hline
       \multicolumn{1}{|c}{\em Mode}  &
       \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\em Effect}                                               \\
      \hline
        {\em s}           & open~a~server                                            \\
        {\em S}           & open~a~server but, on failure, retry after using Srmsrvr \\
        {\em c}           & open~a~client                                            \\
        {\em b}           & open~a~blocking~client                                   \\
        {\em s\verb`###`} & open~a~server with the specified port number             \\
        {\em S\verb`###`} & like {\em S} above, but with the specified port          \\
        {\em c\verb`###`} & open~a~client to~a~server with the specified port        \\
      \hline
      \end{tabular}
      \end{center}

    The {\em skthost} is the name of the server.  If one is making~a~{\em
    client} Socket, then one may optionally use the form
    ``servername@hostname'' for the skthost.  The ``@hostname'' form is not
    necessary for clients to servers that are on the same host as the client,
    as the default host is the local host.  The ``servername@hostname'' form
    makes no sense for servers, and so, for opening servers, Sopen will ignore
    any ``@hostname'' portion of skthost.

    The {\em ``S''} mode for opening servers, like the {\em ``s''} mode, will
    cause Sopen to attempt to open~a~server, but if unsuccessful, Sopen will
    then use Srmsrvr using the provided skthost and then retry opening the
    server.  In the case of {\em s\verb`###`} or {\em S\verb`###`}, the servers
    are set up with the \TCP\ option {\small SO\_REUSEADDR}.  This option
    alleviates some of the difficulties associated with re-starting servers
    with fixed ports.

    If the skthost is null or an empty string (""), the PortMaster is bypassed.
    One must specify a port number to use in that case.  A warning is issued
    (as well as a null \verb`Socket*`) because that is typically a programming
    error, not a user error.

    The PortMaster is also always bypassed for clients which specify port
    number ({\em c\verb`###`}).  In the latter case,~a~client connection is
    immediately attempted to the user-specified port number.  If the function
    is not successful,~a~null Socket pointer is returned.

    If the user-specified server port mode is used with a skthost, the server
    will be registered with its PortMaster; clients need {\em not} use
    specified-port mode to connect (ie.~they may set \verb`mode` to \verb`"c"`)
    so long as they specify the correct name of the server.

    PortMaster sharing (by setting the environment variable \verb`PMSHARE`)
    causes servers to work with the {\em\small PMSHARE\/}-specified
    machine's PortMaster.  Clients should use the name of the machine that
    the {\em PortMaster} is on; the eventual connection will be made with the
    appropriate server program, even though it is running on~a~different
    machine than the PortMaster it uses. See Example~\ref{pmsharing} for
    an illustration of how PortMaster sharing works.

\item[Socket *Sopenv(char *srvrname,char *ctrl,char *envvar)] \     The {\em Sopenv} function is used to open client Sockets, but is formulated
    to resemble the {\em Sopen} function with one additional argument.
    Assuming your computer system supports the concept of environment
    variables, the Sopenv function can use an environment variable of your
    choice to help it open~a~client.  Typically,~a~{\small SKTPATH} environment
    variable gets set up by the user with~a~colon-separated list of machine
    names (ex. setenv {\small SKTPATH} ``gryphon:dragon:xorn'').  The Sopenv
    function attempts to open~a~client to~a~server of the given name on the
    current machine first, and then attempts to do so on each machine in the
    given sequence.  If \verb`env_var` is NULL or~a~null string, then
    \verb`SKTPATH` will be used instead.

    If successful,~a~Socket pointer is returned, otherwise~a~{\small NULL}
    Socket pointer is returned.  Please see Saccept on how to use servers.

\item[int Speek(Socket *skt, char *buf, int buflen)] \     The {\em Speek} function behaves like Sread --- up to {\em buflen} bytes,
    the buffer will be filled by whatever is currently on the Socket.  This
    function does not remove those bytes from the Socket, however, and those
    bytes will be returned again on subsequent Speek, Sread, etc.\ calls.  This
    function does \underline{not} block (aka hang, sleep).

    It will return EOF on select error, some negative number on recv error,
    zero if no data is present on the Socket, and~a~positive count of the
    available bytes otherwise.  In the latter case, {\em buf} will have~a~copy
    of the bytes available.

    {\small MS-DOS}: Speek will only return~a~1 when data is available on
    the Socket, not the number of bytes available.  Furthermore, the buffer
    {\em buf} will be~a~zero-length string with just~a~null byte.

\item[unsigned long Speeraddr(Socket *skt)] \     The {\em Speeraddr} function returns the internet address of the
    peer Socket.

\item[char *Speername(Socket *skt)] \     The {\em Speername} function returns the name of the peer Socket.
    Internally, it has three buffers; thus it can be used up to three times
    in the same printf statement.

\item[void Sprintf(Socket *skt, char *fmt,...)] \     The {\em Sprintf} function acts in an analogous fashion to fprintf,
    sprintf, etc, by putting formatted strings, appropriately null byte
    terminated,  through the Socket.  Thus, one may use either {\em Sgets} or
    an appropriate {\em Sscanf} to receive the information.

\item[char *Sprtskt(Socket *skt)] \     The {\em Sprtskt} function returns~a~string describing the Socket.

\item[void Sputs(char *buf, Socket *skt)] \     The {\em Sputs} function puts~a~null byte terminated string on the Socket
    in~a~fashion analogous to fputs.

\item[int Sread(Socket *skt, char *buf, int buflen)] \     The {\em Sread} function is similar to the {\em read}
    function in Unix.  This function can block (aka hang, sleep) if nothing is
    on the Socket.  Otherwise, it will return up to {\em buflen} bytes in the
    buffer ``{\em buf}''.  This function will return whatever is on the Socket,
    and doesn't try to insure that buflen bytes are read.  It returns the
    number of bytes read from the Socket.

    On error, an EOF is returned.

\item[int Sreadbytes(Socket *skt, char *buf, int buflen)] \     The {\em Sreadbytes} function behaves much like Sread, and it too can block
    (aka hang, sleep) if nothing is on the Socket.  However, it will not return
    until buflen bytes are read from the Socket and placed in ``buf''.

    On error, an EOF is returned.

\item[int Srmsrvr(char *skthost)] \     The {\em Srmsrvr} function is made available to take care of those
    situations when {\small skt = Sopen(``servername'',``s'')} fails because
    the servername has been inadvertently left in the PortMaster's PortTable.
    This untoward event can happen, for example, when~a~process is
    aborted/exited without calling Sclose on its server(s).  The Srmsrvr
    function will remove~a~server (or server@host) from the PortMaster's
    PortTable.  Note: it will \underline{not} close the associated Socket, nor
    free up any Socket memory, and is \underline{not}~a~substitute for Sclose.

    The {\em Srmsrvr} function will return either {\small PM\_OK} (if
    successful) or {\small PM\_SORRY} (otherwise).

\item[int Sscanf(Socket *skt, char *fmt, ...)] \     The {\em Sscanf} function acts much the same as sscanf and fscanf, taking
    format strings and additional arguments in~a~like manner.  The arguments
    Sscanf takes, of course, must all be appropriate pointers.  This function
    will block if insufficient data is available on the socket according to the
    {\em fmt}.

    The {\em Sscanf} function returns the number of arguments for which it read
    data, which may be zero or incomplete if~a~socket error occurred.
    Normally, the returned count should equal the number of arguments with
    which Sscanf was provided.

\item[int Stest(Socket *skt)] \     The {\em Stest} function allows one to determine if anything is available
    on the specified Socket, {\em without blocking}.

    It will return EOF on select error, some negative number on recv error,
    zero if no data is present on the Socket, and~a~positive count of the
    available bytes otherwise.

    {\small MS-DOS}: Stest will only return~a~1 when data is available
    on the Socket, not the number of bytes available.

\item[int Stestfd(int fd)] \     The {\em Stestfd} function allows one to determine if anything is available
    on the specified file descriptor, {\em without blocking}.

    It will return EOF on select error, some negative number on recv error,
    zero if no data is present on the file descriptor, and~a~positive count of the
    available bytes otherwise.

    {\small MS-DOS}: Stestfd will only return~a~1 when data is available
    on the file descriptor, not the number of bytes available.

\item[int Stimeoutwait(Socket *skt,long seconds,long useconds)] \     The {\em Stimeoutwait} function blocks on the given Socket, but for no
    longer than the number of seconds plus the number of microseconds specified.
    The function returns the number of bytes available on the Socket (which may be
    zero), -1 if there was an error, and -2 on timeout.

\item[int Svprintf(Socket *skt, char *fmt, void *args)] \     The {\em Svprintf} function reads bytes using~a~printf family format string
    from the Socket.  As each format code is processed, the associated argument
    is changed in the {\em args} vector.  It returns the number of format items
    processed.

\item[int Swait(Socket *skt)] \     The {\em Swait} function will block (aka hang, sleep) until the specified
    Socket has data available.

    It will return EOF on select error, some negative number on recv error,
    zero if no data is present on the Socket, and~a~positive count of the
    available bytes otherwise.

\item[int Swrite(Socket *skt, char *buf, int buflen)] \     The {\em Swrite} function will write {\em buflen} bytes from the {\em buf}
    buffer onto the specified Socket.

    The function will return~a~count of the number of bytes transmitted through
    the Socket, which should be equal to {\em buflen}.  If the output is less
    than {\em buflen}, then an error occurred while writing to the Socket.

\end{description}


\subsection{Hints}

The {\em Hints} below have been found useful at the Intelligent Robotics
Laboratory.  They are based on almost a~year's experience with the \SSL.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item The ``Sscanf'' function is dangerous.  It will block until all of
    the format codes in its {\em fmt} string have been used.  If somehow
   ~a~programmer sends an improper string and Sscanf is used to receive it,
    then the receiving program will probably hang for quite~a~while.
    Dr.~Campbell has found that it is somewhat safer to use {\em Sgets} to
    get an entire string from the Socket and then use {\em sscanf} and
    {\em stpnxt} to parse it.

  \item Polling is unfriendly to other processes -- it wastes~a~tremendous
    amount of {\small CPU} time merely querying the Socket(s) to see if
    anything is awaiting action.  The various blocking functions are much
    better: Swait, Stimeoutwait, Smask{\small XXX}, etc.

  \item Unless your processes will always run on the same kind of machine,
    portability considerations argue against using Sread and Swrite to move
    non-character string data around -- ie. floats, doubles, and even ints.
    Even if the programmer tests out the machines and verifies that (s)he
    can safely move, say,~a~double around, or even~a~vector of doubles,
    data structures (\verb`struct XXX { ... }`) may have ``holes'' in them
    placed there for word or byte alignment reasons.  These ``holes'' may
    not be there (or may be placed differently) by other machines and compilers.

  \item The Srmsrvr function is~a~rather rude function -- there is no
    ownership check of~a~server.  Please use your process name (or your id) as
    part of your server name so that servers do not clash.  Remember: your
    server's name is in only one ``name space'' shared by all users on your
    machine.

  \item For those of you who wish to use other services (ex.~serial ports)
    which can use the {\em select} function provided by \TCP, check out Smaskfdset
    and its mate, Smaskunfdset.

  \item The \IRL\ has been using~a~leading two character command
    convention:     \verb`tp~L~x~y~z rx ry rz` will tell the ``left'' T3 robot to
    move to ``x~y~z'' (inches) in space with an orientation of ``rx ry rz''
    degrees (roll, pitch, yaw).  Longer words provide more readability but take
    up more bandwidth.  Experimentally, Dr.~Campbell has found that \TCP
    can transfer about 10,000 packets per second with up to 128 bytes in a
    packet.  Loaded systems will, of course, achieve less throughput.

  \item It is~a~good idea for clients to inform servers that they are
    quitting.  The \IRL\ has used the following convention:  \verb`tq`
    {\em t\/}ells the server that the messaging client is {\em q\/}uitting.
    Also,~a~\verb`tQ` tells the server to shut itself down.  The server then
    emits~a~\verb`tq` to all of its clients to inform them that the server is
    shutting down (except for the one client who issued the shutdown command),
    and then closes itself down with Sclose.

  \item The server-client relationship is intimately involved with
    object-oriented messaging -- refer to the literature on object-oriented
    concepts.

  \item The {\SSL} can be used to support~a~{\em no startup sequencing} paradigm.
    Typically, clients who attempt to Sopen and fail should go into a
    poll - sleep loop:

     \begin{example} Client Socket Polling      \\ \label{client-polling}
      \begin{verbatim}
         skt= Sopen("servername","c");
         while(!skt) {
           sleep(1);
           skt= Sopen("servername","c");
           }
      \end{verbatim}
     \end{example}

    The {\em multiskt.c} program illustrates how servers should be able
    to accept multiple clients using blocking judiciously.

    This non-sequencing approach allows one to bring up programs which have
    servers and/or clients without worrying about what comes first.  For two
    programs, this isn't terribly serious, but at the \IRL\ numerous
    programs providing numerous services are available and sequencing would
    be~a~nightmare.

  \item As alluded to earlier, clients should tell servers and servers should
    tell clients when they are going down.  The program that is {\em not}
    quitting should return to an ``awaiting another client (or server)'' mode
    (ie.~see the preceding item).  Thus,~a~troublesome program can be brought
    down, the programs to which it is communicating will gracefully terminate
    their connections, and the programmer can then (hopefully) fix the problem.
    When the program is restarted, the non-sequencing approach will allow the
    program to seamlessly re-enter into communications with the other software.

  \item When~a~machine is down, and an attempt to connect~a~client Socket using
    either {\em Sopen\/} directly or {\em Sopenv\/} to~a~server either normally
    or possibly on that machine, the Sopen will fail but will take an inordinately
    long time doing so (connection timeout).

 \item When~a~program dies abruptly, connected Sockets appear to {\em select}()
   to have something on them (select is used by Stest, Smasktest, Swait,
   Smaskwait, Speek, Stimeoutwait).  Hence, functions which normally block
   (Smaskwait, Swait) no longer block.  On computers which can {\small
   MSG\_PEEK} (Unix, Vms), the Stest, Speek, Sgets, and Sscanf functions will
   detect this situation and will return an error indication ({\small EOF},
   {\small NULL} pointer, incomplete argument processed count) to indicate that
   the Socket has~a~problem (one should then Sclose the affected Socket).

   Furthermore, attempts to write to such dead Sockets may generate
   {\small SIGPIPE}s on Unix boxes.  Unix programmers should write and install
   signal handlers for {\small SIGPIPE}s.

  \item For multiple concurrent Sockets, one should generate routines for both
   closing and opening them.

    \begin{example} Client Opening Function              \\ \label{client-opening}
     \begin{verbatim}
         #include "sockets.h"
         typedef struct clientlist_str ClientList;
         struct clientlist_str {
             Socket *skt;
             ClientList *nxt,*prv;
             }
         ClientList *clhd=NULL;
         ClientList *cltl=NULL;
          ...
         ClientList *openClient(char *srvrname)
         {
         Socket *skt;
         ClientList *clist;
         while(1) {
             skt= Sopen(srvrname,"c");
             if(!skt) sleep(1);
             }
         clist= (ClientList *) malloc(sizeof(ClientList));
         if(cltl) cltl->nxt= clist;
         else     clhd     = clist;
         clist->prv= cltl;
         clist->nxt= NULL;
         cltl      = clist;
         Smaskset(skt);
         clist->skt= skt;
         return clist;
         }
     \end{verbatim}
    \end{example}

    The \verb`openClient`() function polls once~a~second in attempting to
    open~a~client Socket.  Once it succeeds,~a~ClientList data structure
    is allocated, double-linked, and~a~pointer to it returned.  In addition,
    the new client Socket is added to the Smask.

   \begin{example} Client Closing Function               \\ \label{client-closing}
    \begin{verbatim}
         void closeClient(ClientList *clist)
         {
         if(clist) {
             Smaskunset(clist->skt);
             Sclose(clist->skt);
             clist->skt= NULL;
             }
         }
    \end{verbatim}
   \end{example}

   The \verb`closeClient`() function removes the client Socket from the Smask
   system, closes the Socket, and then sets the skt pointer to NULL to guarantee
   that the now dead socket won't be inadvertently re-used somehow.

  \item It is usually advisable to use some sort of handshaking protocol between
   server and client, especially when large data blocks are being moved.  The {\TCP}    buffers can easily get filled and data get lost otherwise.  To facilitate this,
   the {\SSL} sets sockets up with the {\small TCP\_NODELAY} option so that small
   packets are moved out across and not collected (collection of small packets
   normally improves network efficiency since there's less overhead per byte of data).

\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\section{The PortMaster}

Servers have names provided by the program which opens them.  When~a~server is
to be opened, the Sopen function temporarily opens~a~Socket to the PortMaster
running on the same machine.  The Sopen function then tells the PortMaster the
server's {\em name} and the (random) {\em port} assigned to the new server, and
then closes down the connection.  The PortMaster retains~a~list of all active
servers and ports running on its machine.

A~client is opened using the Sopen function, too.  In that case,~a~connection
is made to the PortMaster on the machine where the requested server is
running.  The PortMaster then tells the Sopen function the port number
associated with the requested server, and then closes down the temporary
connection.  The Sopen function then attempts to connect to the server using
the given port.

The server program can use its server Socket to test if any clients are waiting
to be connected to it (via the Stest function).  If~a~client is waiting, then
the server's program can {\em accept} the connection, generating an accept
Socket (via Saccept).  Once the connection is accepted, the program attempting
to open the client Socket will finally receive~a~Socket pointer.


\subsection{Users Guide}

The PortMaster is probably the simplest program to run:  under {\small UNIX},
type \verb`Spm &` and under {\small VMS} type \verb`run/detach Spm`.  The
PortMaster will only allow one copy of itself to run on any given computer.  It
uses~a~fixed port address ($1750$, now registered with {\small IANA}) and
implements~a~table of server names mapping to random ports.  Although
knowledgeable users could change the PortMaster's fixed port, this is
discouraged: hopefully, PortMasters will proliferate across the world and, if
they all use the same port on their machines, will be able to communicate with
one another.  In other words, the {\SSL} will be unable to communicate with
other {\SSL} systems which use~a~different port for its PortMaster.

Since {\small MS-DOS} is not~a~multi-tasking operating system, unlike
{\small UNIX}, {\small VMS}, or {\small Amiga-DOS}, one cannot have a
PortMaster running in the background --- there is no background.  Hence,
{\small MS-DOS} programs are currently restricted to using client Sockets only,
{\em unless} they can share another machine's PortMaster (see below).

The PortMaster now supports~a~firewall: one can instruct the PortMaster
to restrict access to~a~group of machines by their host addresses.  See the
section on {\em The PortMaster Firewall} below.

\subsection{Sharing PortMasters}

PortMasters can now be {\em shared}.  This feature was installed mainly to
support {\small MSDOS} -- since it doesn't have~a~background process
capability, it cannot run PortMasters.  Hence, it is normally restricted to
running clients only, because servers normally announce their presence to their
host's PortMaster.  If the environment variable \verb`PMSHARE` is set to some other
machine, that other machine's PortMaster will be used by the host's processes
attempting to open servers.  From the client's viewpoint, the server appears to
be on the machine with the PortMaster -- the client doesn't need to know about
where the server actually is.

In Example~\ref{pmsharing}, three machines are in use.  However, machines
B~and~C~could have been the same machine.  In essence, when~A~shares B's
PortMaster, the servers on~A~appear to be on~B~insofar as Sopen'ing~a~client
is concerned.  Internally, of course, B's PortMaster knows where the {\em ASrvr}
is, and clients end up being connected to the server on machine A.

\subsection{Theory of Operation}

Normally, users of the {\SSL} will not need to read this section.  However,
for those who are curious...

There are two main benefits to using the \SSL: the functions are similar
to those that the~C~programmer already knows how to use and hence the {\SSL} 
has~a~rapid learning curve, and second, servers are assigned to currently
available ports.  The PortMaster is integral to providing the second benefit.

Berkeley sockets are assigned ports, which are basically just integers.  The
port is used internally to assign the flow of data to the correct places.
One must assign~a~specific port to~a~server or, alternatively, allow the
system to assign any available port to it.  Clients must use that same port
number to connect to the desired server.  Hence, the problem with using the
``any available port'' is how to get the client process to know what the
currently assigned port is!  Programmers using Berkeley sockets have typically
just assigned~a~fixed port to their server and hard-coded the clients with that
port.  If some other process just happens to use that same port, then things
get messy -- re-compile, wait until the other process goes away, etc.  On a
machine where there are many users, co-operation between the users may be
impractical.

The PortMaster solves the problem of associating~a~server name with~a~randomly
assigned (and available) port, and making that association available to
clients.  The PortMaster itself uses~a~fixed port, and so servers and clients
always know ``where'' it is.  Whenever~a~server opens (using the Sopen("{\small
XXX}","s") call), the Sopen function makes~a~Socket data structure, creates a
Berkeley socket, initializes and binds the socket with any available port, and
then connects to the PortMaster, {\em using its fixed port}.  It then sends a
``message'' ({\small PM\_SERVER}, which is simply an integer) to the
PortMaster, telling it the type of Socket it is.  Subsequently, the PortMaster
gets the new server's name and the port it is assigned to.

When~a~client opens, it makes~a~Socket, initializes~a~Berkeley socket as a
client (using the {\small AF\_INET} format), gets~a~``host'' entity pointer
(the server's machine is known as~a~host), and then connects to the PortMaster
on the host machine.  It then sends~a~``{\small PM\_CLIENT}'' to that
PortMaster and the desired server's name; that PortMaster will respond with the
associated port number (if there is one).  The client then closes down the
connection to the target host's PortMaster, and initializes~a~Berkeley socket
with the port number it just received and returns~a~client Socket pointer to
the user.

Thus, the \SSL's PortMaster system is~a~distributed database.  There are
advantages and disadvantages to this scheme. No PortMaster knows anything about
servers residing on other machines; if~a~machine goes down, other machines
which have no need to communicate with the downed machine are not affected.

On the other hand,~a~single machine with~a~single PortMaster would obviate the
need for clients to know what machines they wish to connect to, and could
force servers on all machines to have unique names (as it is, servers can have
the same name so long as they run on different machines).  As~a~palliative, the
{\em Sopenv} function supports the concept of~a~{\em machine path} via the
use of environment variables.  Using the Sopenv function, clients can ``hunt''
down~a~given server by attempting to open~a~client one at~a~time on each machine
until~a~server of that name is found.  Thus, the user can designate~a~local
group of machines via an environment variable (typically, the
``{\small SKTPATH}'' environment variable is used for this purpose).

The PortMaster talks to its temporary clients using~a~relatively simple
protocol based on ``messages'' (integers) defined in the \verb`sockets.h`
header file.  Table~\ref{portmaster} illustrates the protocol.  If the
PortMaster is using its firewall capability, it immediately checks all of
its temporary clients for approved machine status;~a~{\small PM\_SORRY} is
issued immediately prior to the protocol in Table~\ref{portmaster} upon
failure to be approved.  The connection is then summarily severed.

As indicated in Table~\ref{portmaster}, the PortMaster handles more events than
just the {\small PM\_SERVER} and {\small PM\_CLIENT} events mentioned earlier.
When~a~client opens to the PortMaster, it identifies the type of service it
wishes by sending that PortMaster~a~``message'':  {\small PM\_SERVER}, {\small
PM\_CLIENT}, {\small PM\_CLOSE}, {\small PM\_TABLE}, or {\small PM\_QUIT}.
These messages are discussed below.  Whenever the PortMaster does not
understand the initial message (due to garbling or whatever), the PortMaster
will immediately issue~a~{\small PM\_RESEND} message and then wait for data.
It will continue doing so for up to {\small PM\_MAXTRY} times (in the
\verb`sockets.h` file as sent, {\small PM\_MAXTRY} is defined as $20$).  If the
limit of re-tries is reached, the PortMaster will peremptorily close down the
connection and go back to its usual quiescent state waiting for~a~new
connection.

The PortMaster will wait no more than {\small TIMEOUT} seconds for data, which
is set to 20 seconds in \verb`Spm.c` as delivered.  If that amount of time
elapses, the PortMaster will summarily close down the temporary client and
continue for more business.

\begin{description}

  \item[{\small PM\_CLIENT}] tells the PortMaster that~a~client is attempting
       to open.  The PortMaster normally responds with~a~{\small PM\_OK} and the
       program attempting to open~a~client responds with~a~null-byte terminated
       string (the requested server name).  If the PortMaster finds the requested
       server in its list, then it responds with~a~{\small PM\_OK} and then the
       port number, otherwise it sends~a~{\small PM\_SORRY}.
     
       If the PortMaster is using~a~firewall, it may respond immediately with
      ~a~{\small PM\_SORRY} if the client is originating from an unapproved
       machine.

  \item[{\small PM\_CLIENTWAIT}] acts much like a {\small PM\_CLIENT}, except
        that the PortMaster will wait (block) before sending the final
        {\small PM\_OK} and port number.  Thus clients can request a block
        until the desired server is up.

  \item[{\small PM\_CLOSE}] tells the PortMaster that~a~server is closing down.
       The PortMaster will normally respond with~a~{\small PM\_OK}; the program
       closing down the server (via {\em Sclose}) will then send the port number.
       The PortMaster will then remove the associated server from its internal
       list of servers and respond with~a~{\small PM\_OK} if the designated
       server was in its list and~a~{\small PM\_SORRY} otherwise.

  \item[{\small PM\_FWINIT}] tells the PortMaster to re-read its firewall
       datafile.  The PortMaster will then respond with~a~{\small PM\_OK} if
       it worked or {\small PM\_RESEND} if something got garbled.

  \item[{\small PM\_QUIT}] tells the PortMaster that~a~shutdown command is
       to be sent.  The PortMaster responds with~a~{\small PM\_OK}, and the program
       shutting down the PortMaster issues~a~null-byte terminated string,
       ``PortMaster'' (just to guarantee that~a~shutdown is really wanted).  The
       PortMaster will then shutdown.  This operation requires some knowledge of
       the protocol as no {\SSL} function is provided to make shutting down the
       PortMaster easy.  However, the \verb`sktdbg` program does provide an easy
       way to shut down the PortMaster.  Concerned system administrators may wish
       to remove the ``shut'' command from \verb`sktdbg`.  Shutting down the
       PortMaster does not affect currently connected Sockets; however, new
       connections between servers and clients cannot be made.  On the other hand,
       starting up~a~new PortMaster is easy and anyone may do so -- the \verb`Spm`
       program itself will refuse to allow two PortMasters to run concurrently (and
       will say so).

  \item[{\small PM\_SERVER}] tells the PortMaster that~a~server has been
       opened.  The PortMaster will normally respond with~a~{\small PM\_OK}
       and then the program opening~a~server will send~a~string giving the
       new server's name and then will send its port.
     
       The PortMaster will then respond with~a~{\small PM\_OK} upon success or
      ~a~{\small PM\_SORRY} if~a~server by that name already exists.
     
       If the PortMaster is using~a~firewall, it may respond immediately with a
       {\small PM\_SORRY} if the server is originating from an unapproved machine.
       When PortMaster sharing is not operating, this event should never occur, as
       servers can then only be legally generated on the same machine that the
       PortMaster resides upon.  The PortMaster enters its own host onto its
       internal firewall table whenever use of~a~firewall is enabled.

  \item[{\small PM\_TABLE}] tells the PortMaster to give out~a~list of the
       servers it currently knows about.  Normally the PortMaster will respond with
      ~a~{\small PM\_OK},~a~count of servers (in network standard 2-byte format,
       see the Berkeley ``ntohs'' function for details), and~a~sequence of strings
       giving the server name and associated port number.  The \verb`spmtable`
       program and \verb`sktdbg`'s ``table'' function use this facility.

\end{description}

\subsubsection{The PortMaster Firewall}

The PortMaster supports~a~{\em firewall} to keep out socket requests from
unapproved machines.  The firewall consists of~a~list of machines' internet
addresses in~a~file.  One specifies the file by one of two methods:

 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Startup with \verb# Spm -f#{\em full-path-to-filename}
  \item Initialization of an environment variable, {\small SPMFIREWALL},
        to the {\em full-path-to-filename}.
 \end{enumerate}

The {\em full-path-to-filename} file contains records of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
  * * number number number number
\end{verbatim}

where the four \verb`number`s are the internet addresses of the machines
permitted to talk to the PortMaster.  The \verb`*` indicates accept any number
in that field.  The firewall function examines incoming internet addresses by
use of the {\em getpeername} function.

The firewall file, often called {\em spmfirewall.dat}, may contain blank
lines.  The \verb`#` is assumed to begin~a~comment and is stripped off.

\section{The Utilities}

There are several utilities provided with the \SSL, and they are explained
below.  These are all complete programs in themselves, and can serve as
lessons on how to use the \SSL.

\begin{description}

  \item[sktdbg] \verb`server-name {s|c}`     {\em sktdbg} is the \SSL's testing program.  One may open server Sockets,
    accept Sockets, and client Sockets, test out how other program's Sockets
    are communicating, etc.  See the subsection on {\em sktdbg} below.  The
    ``server-name'' may take two forms: \verb`servername` or
    \verb`servername@machine-name`.  The latter form may be used when
    attempting to open clients to servers residing on machines other than the
    one the user is currently running \verb`sktdbg` on.

  \item[spmchk] \verb`[machine]`     This program tests the current machine by default, the named machine
    otherwise, for the presence of~a~PortMaster.  It will return~a~0 if
    the PortMaster is present, or~a~1 otherwise, and is useful in scripts:

      \begin{center}
       spmchk \verb`||` (nohup Spm \verb`>` /dev/null \&)       \end{center}

    Translated for non-csh/ksh users: if spmchk finds no PortMaster on the
    current machine, start one up in the background in ``no hangup on user
    exit'' mode, with output headed to the bit bucket. {\small (thanks go
    to Marty Olevitch for this program)}.

    For {\small VMS} users:

      \begin{center}
       \begin{minipage}[h]{5in}
        \begin{verbatim}
spmchk:= [fullpath]spmchk.exe
set noon
spmchk
if '$SEVERITY' .ne. 1 then run/detach [fullpath]Spm.exe
set on
        \end{verbatim}
       \end{minipage}
      \end{center}

  \item[spmtable] \verb`[machine [machine [machine ...]]]`     This program lists the servers and port numbers on the requested machines.
    If no machine is listed, then the current machine will be used.

  \item[srmsrvr] \verb`[server-name [server-name [server-name ...]]]`     Sometimes the all-knowledgeable and omnipotent programmer finds~a~need to
    hit the control-c key or otherwise kill~a~running program with~a~server
    Socket.  In such cases, the PortMaster does not get informed that the
    server has gone down.  This utility will tell the PortMaster to forcibly
    remove the named server(s) from its list.

\end{description}

Except when using \verb`sktdbg` to open~a~server with \verb`sktdbg`, the server
names above can also have the form \verb`srvr@machine-name`.  This name
specifies~a~server on~a~specific machine.  Note that the machine-name is its
normal abbreviation (ie.~hostname) or its full name (ie.~hostname.someplace.com).


\subsection{The \texttt{sktdbg} Program}

The \verb`sktdbg` program was originally~a~testing facility to debug the {\SSL} 
itself, but has proven exceptionally useful in debugging programs which use the
\SSL.  Consequently, it is provided as part of the package.

To start up \verb`sktdbg`, one must choose between starting up~a~server or
attempting to open~a~client Socket.

\begin{example} Starting up~a~sktdbg Server \\ \label{sktdbg-srvr}
sktdbg servername s
\end{example}

\begin{example} Starting up~a~sktdbg Client \\ \label{sktdbg-client}
sktdbg servername c
\end{example}

One may also ask sktdbg to explain itself.

\begin{example} sktdbg Explanation \\ \label{sktdbg-explain}
sktdbg "?"
\end{example}

When the \verb`sktdbg` program is started, the first thing it does is attempt
to create the requested type of Socket.  Typically, attempts to make~a~server
will succeed; if it doesn't, it will report~a~warning, apply Srmsrvr(), and try
a~second time to open the server again.  If it fails twice, then usually the
PortMaster is not running on your machine.

Attempts to open~a~client to~a~non-existent server also yields an error
message: ``unable to Sopen(srvrname,c)''.  If the server is up and running,
then~a~client Socket will be set up.

The \verb`sktdbg` program then prints out~a~little menu of actions that the
user can take with it.

\begin{table}[thb]
  \begin{center}
  \caption{sktdbg Help Menu}
  \label{sktdbg-help}
  \begin{verbatim}
Socket Test Commands
  accept
  close
  fwinit
  fput
  get
  menu
  peek
  printf
  put
  q
  quit
  read
  rmsrvr
  scanf
  shutdown
  table
  test
  wait
  write
  ?
(   0 bytes) Enter: 
  \end{verbatim}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

The ``Enter'' prompt now also shows the number of bytes waiting on the queue
for reading.  This number is updated only when the prompt is generated; ie. it
is not~a~dynamic value, but is often useful.

In Table~\ref{sktdbg-help}, there are 20 commands available, and are
described below.

\begin{description}

  \item[accept] \   Used by~a~server Socket to accept clients.  Note that one
  may first do {\em test} to determine if~a~client is waiting.

  \item[close] \   Used by~a~server Socket to close down an accept Socket.

  \item[fput] \   This function takes~a~filename, {\em fput filename}, which sktdbg then opens.
  Every line in it, minus trailing white space, is sent via Sputs across the
  Socket.  Sktdbg then closes the file.

  \item[fwinit] \   This call issues~a~{\small PM\_FWINIT} to the local machine's PortMaster.
  The PortMaster will then re-read the firewall data file that it was optionally
  started up with (if it had none, then this command will have no effect).  The
  fwinit command is useful for the owner of the firewall data file to change it
  and have the PortMaster update itself without bringing down the PortMaster and
  restarting it.

  \item[get] \   Uses Sgets to get~a~null-terminated string from the client.  This call will
  block until something arrives for up to 60 seconds.

  \item[isset] \   Uses Smaskwait() with negligible timeout (1 microsecond!) and then uses
  Smaskisset() to determine if the socket is read-ready.  This function
  was included mostly for testing Smaskisset().

  \item[menu] \   Repeats the {\em Socket Test Commands} menu (just like ``?'' below).

  \item[peek] \   Uses Speek to peek at what the client has sent.  This call
  will not block, even if nothing is there yet.

  \item[printf] printf your-word   Uses Sprintf to send "your-word 7 8. itworked!" through the Socket.

  \item[put] put your various sundry strings across   Uses Sputs to send your strings on the same line through the Socket.

  \item[q] \   This function ``quits'' -- uses Sclose to close down all Sockets that
  \verb`sktdbg` is using and exits.  Just like ``quit''.

  \item[quit] \   This function ``quits'' -- uses Sclose to close down all Sockets that
  \verb`sktdbg` is using and exits.  Just like ``q''.

  \item[read] \   This function uses Sread to read whatever is on the Socket, and prints
  it out assuming that it received~a~string.

  \item[rmsrvr] rmsrvr server-name   This function uses Srmsrvr to remove~a~server.

  \item[scanf] \   This function accepts~a~subset of format code: \%c, \%d, \%f, and \%s.
  It will call Sscanf once for each format code given to it.

  \item[shutdown] \   This function is {\em dangerous}!  It will shut down the PortMaster on
  your current machine and perform~a~quit.  Use of this function is
  strongly discouraged unless it is necessary to pull down~a~PortMaster.

  \item[table] \   The {\em table} function communicates with the PortMaster and prints out
 ~a~table of all current servers and their ports (rather like spmtable).

  \item[test] \   The {\em test} function prints out the number of bytes awaiting perusal
  by~a~get or read operation.  It does not block, even if nothing is
  waiting -- it will return 0 in such~a~case.

  \item[wait] \   This function will block the process until something shows up on the
  accept or client Socket.

  \item[write] write your sundry thoughts and words   This function will {\em Swrite} your words, appropriately null-byte
  terminated, through the Socket.  It can be read by the {\em read} function.

  \item[?] \   Repeats the {\em Socket Test Commands} menu (just like ``menu'' above).

\end{description}

This program is really quite simple to learn and run, and is useful to help
the installer verify that the {\SSL} is installed correctly.


\newpage
\section{Installation Instructions}

Installation varies, of course, from operating system to operating system.


\subsection{Unix}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Make~a~{\tt SKTS} subdirectory somewhere, and extract the contents
    of the tape into that subdirectory (typically, {\tt tar -xvop}, but
    systems will vary and you may need to specify~a~tape drive).

  \item If your machine is not {\small ANSI C} compliant, but supports
    prototyping anyway, edit the \verb`sockets.h` file to \verb`#`define {\small
    \_\_PROTOTYPE\_\_} for your machine.

  \item Type {\tt make all}.

\end{enumerate}

These instructions should result in the {\SSL} being compiled, the utilities
being compiled, and the PortMaster being compiled. ~A~{\em simpleskts.a}
library results.  Although the PortMaster gets started by the make
instructions, you may occasionally need to re-start it (for example, after the
computer goes down).  System administrators should know how to modify their
operating system to automatically bring up the PortMaster during~a~re-boot.

Users may wish to place 

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    setenv SKTPATH machine:machine:machine...` & csh users   \\
    export SKTPATH=machine:machine:machine...` & ksh users   \\
    SKTPATH:==machine:machine:machine...`      & vms users   \\
    set SKTPATH=machine:machine:machine...`    & msdos users \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent
in their .login, .profile, login.com, and autoexec.bat respectively.  To link
to the \SSL, one must include ``sockets.h''.  For example, under {\small UNIX},
a~user should have~a~{\small .HDR} subdirectory with all his/her favorite
header files and use ``\verb`cc ...  -I~/.HDR ... simpleskts.a`''.


\subsection{Vms}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Make~a~{\tt SKTS} subdirectory somewhere, and extract the contents
   of the tape into that subdirectory.  The original tape was~a~quarter-inch
   cartridge in Unix tar format, but you may well receive~a~different format.

  \item Type \verb`@makeskts`
\end{enumerate}

The ``makeskts'' command script will create several subdirectories, compile the
\SSL, and set up~a~``simpleskts.olb'' library.  It will {\bf not} attempt to
start up the PortMaster.  Change to the ``{\small EXE}'' subdirectory under the
{\small SKTS} subdirectory.  The PortMaster should be started via
\verb`run/detach Spm`; you may or may not have sufficient privileges to do so.
One may spawn the PortMaster, but as soon as you log off the PortMaster will
rudely terminate.  Due to the potential problem with privileges, the command
script will not start up the PortMaster itself.

In order to make use of command-line arguments for sktdbg, etc, {\small VMS} requires
that you first make ``logical symbols.''  In your \verb`<login.com>`,
place the following lines (with appropriately modified {\small YOURDIR}):

 \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lcl}
  \$ spmchk   & :== & \$[{\small YOURDIR.SKTS.EXE}]spmchk.exe   \\
  \$ spmtable & :== & \$[{\small YOURDIR.SKTS.EXE}]spmtable.exe \\
  \$ spm      & :== & \$[{\small YOURDIR.SKTS.EXE}]spm.exe      \\
  \$ srmsrvr  & :== & \$[{\small YOURDIR.SKTS.EXE}]srmsrvr.exe
  \end{tabular}
 \end{center}

\subsection{Windows 95 ( or more recent)}

As of Version 2.08, the {\SSL} runs under Windows 95.  One may
have~a~PortMaster running in the background on those machines,
too!  Since the present author only has Borland C++, only that
compiler has been tested.  Other compilers may need to modify the
\verb`<`Sinit.c\verb`>` file to include any \TCP\ initialization
they may require.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Set up your system with an appropriate~C~compiler, Ethernet card,
       and \TCP.
 \item Copy the contents of <ssl.tar.gz> onto your computer.
 \item Use gunzip and untar to get the uncompressed files
 \item Open~a~{\small MSDOS} console, change directory to ...\verb`\`{\COSMIC}
 \item mkwin95
\end{enumerate}

The {\sf smplskts.lib} and various {\sf *.exe} files should be generated
in the {\COSMIC} subdirectory.  You may well want to have the Simple Sockets
Library's PortMaster (Spm) always running in background.  To accomplish this:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item On your workbench, click the right mouse button
 \item Select {\sf New}
 \item Select {\sf Shortcut}
 \item Put the fully specified path to Spm.exe in the
       {\sf Command Line} dialog box.
 \item Put {\sf Spm} as the shortcut's name
 \item Right-mouse click on the {\sf Spm} shortcut
 \item Select {\sf Properties}
 \item Select the {\sf Shortcut} tab
 \item In the {\sf Run} dialog, left mouse click on the
       down arrow and select {\sf minimized}.
 \item Bring up Explorer
 \item Click on the \verb`+` in the left hand window near {\sf Windows}
 \item Click on the \verb`+` in the left hand window near {\sf Start Menu}
 \item Click on the \verb`+` in the left hand window near {\sf Programs}
 \item Double click on {\sf StartUp}
 \item Put the mouse cursor on the {\sf Spm} shortcut; press the right
       mouse button and drag it over the right hand Explorer window.
 \item Select {\sf Copy Here}.  You will now need to re-boot your machine
       for this operation to take effect.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Older Ms-Dos}

The {\SSL} was compiled and tested using the Wollongong {\TCP} package with
MicroSoft~C~(v6.0).  Other compilers and {\TCP} packages may require adjustment
to the {\SSL} code.  You {\bf must} have~a~\TCP package for your machine,
however -- that is what provides Berkeley sockets over which the {\SSL} provides
a~convenient overlay.  Also, you {\bf must} have an Ethernet card for your
machine -- that provides the hardware over which the information flows.
Neither the {\TCP} package, the~C~compiler, nor the Ethernet hardware come with
the \SSL.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item The {\SSL} makes several assumptions, unfortunately, about
        where include files are (ex. see {\em Speek.c\/}).  The installer
        will undoubtedly need to customize these include lines.  These
        areas will always be in \verb`#ifdef MSDOS` ... \verb`#endif` zones.
  \item Acquire~a~\TCP package for your computer (ie.~Wollongong).
  \item Acquire~a~C compiler for your computer (ie.~Microsoft C, v6.0).
  \item Acquire an Ethernet card and {\TCP} address for your computer.
  \item Copy the contents of the provided diskette into your subdirectory.
  \item For those of you with the software mentioned in
        Table~\ref{msdos-swlist}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Make~a~directory: \verb`c:\c600\socket`
    \item Make~a~directory: \verb`c:\c600\socket\exe`
    \item Copy {\em wintcp.lib} to \verb`c:\c600\socket`
    \item Copy {\em socket.lib} to \verb`c:\c600\socket`
    \item Copy {\em slibce.lib} to \verb`c:\c600\socket`
    \item Disable the {\small MSDOS} linker -- possibly by renaming it
          to {\em doslink}.  Use the MicroSoft~C~linker instead.
    \item Return to the directory where you placed the {\SSL} software.
    \item Type {\em makeskt} (which will use the
        {\em Makeskt.bat} command script).  This script will use
        {\em Makelib.}, compile, create the {\em smplskts.lib} library,
        and generate {\em sktdbg.exe}, {\em spmtable.exe}, and
        {\em srmsrvr.exe}.
    \item You should be done installing the software at this point.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item If your compiler is not {\small ANSI C} compliant, but supports
        prototyping, edit the \verb`sockets.h` file to define {\small
        \_\_PROTOTYPE\_\_} for your machine.
  \item Follow your compiler's directions to compile to object file format
        all the~C~files in \verb`SKTS` and \verb`SKTS\EXE`.
  \item Follow your compiler's directions to set up~a~``library'' (a {\tt .LIB}
        file) with all the {\tt .OBJ} files in the \verb`SKTS` subdirectory.
  \item Change to the \verb`SKTS\EXE` subdirectory and follow your compiler's
        instructions to link each of the object files, one at~a~time, to the
        ``smplskts.lib'' library, the {\TCP} library, and whatever
        libraries your compiler normally needs.

\end{enumerate}

The installation should yield~a~{\em smplskts.lib} (or something similar)
library and three executable files (sktdbg.exe, spmtable.exe, and
spmtable.exe).

Note that the ``{\small SPM.EXE}'' file should not be generated; you could
generate and execute it, but your clone could not use it as it does not allow
the PortMaster to run in the background.  No attempt has been made to insure
that the PortMaster is actually compilable under MicroSoft C, either.  Someday
a~kludge to allow MS-DOS programs to be their own PortMaster may be developed,
but that day is not yet.  Using Wollongong \TCP, one will be restricted to
three (or five if its ``kernel'' is rebuilt) clients.

The software in Table~\ref{msdos-swlist} was used by the \IRL\ and is known to
work properly with the \SSL.  Other software may work but has not been tested.

\newpage
\section{Appendix: Miscellaneous Functions}

The {\SSL} uses nine functions from Dr.~Campbell's {\em xtdio} library; these
have been gathered together and made part of the {\em simpleskts.a} library.
Several of the functions use~a~special data file, {\em rdcolor.dat}.

Note: the {\em error} and {\em outofmem} functions claim they will
``terminate'' under certain conditions.  Actually, they will call the function
{\em (*error\_exit)(int~rtn)}, which by default is the {\em exit} function.
Programmers may easily prevent or otherwise control termination by simply
setting {\em error\_exit} to point to some other function.

\begin{description}

  \item[void error(int severity,char *fmt,...)] \     The {\em error} function prints out an error, warning, or note type of
    message to stdout.  This function takes four kinds of ``severity'': {\small
    SEVERE}, {\small ERROR}, {\small WARNING}, and {\small NOTE}.  Both the
    {\small SEVERE} and {\small ERROR} levels will {\em terminate} the
    program.  The other two, {\small WARNING} and {\small NOTE}, will not do
    so.  The termination action tends to enforce~a~standard for what errors
    versus warnings mean!  If your terminal type is supported by the {\em
    rdcolor.dat} file (see rdcolor below), {\small SEVERE} and {\small ERROR}
    messages are printed with~a~red leader, {\small WARNING}s with~a~yellow
    leader, and {\small NOTE}s with~a~cyan leader.

  \item[FILE *fopenv(char *filename,char *ctrl,char *env\_var)] \     The {\em fopenv} provides~a~file opening service akin to that provided
    by the {\em Sopenv} function for the \SSL.  The {\em fopen()} function
    will be used with the given filename and ctrl strings, and upon failure,
    the environment variable in {\em env\_var} will be used like a
    {\small PATH} variable in attempts to open the file in one directory after
    another (until success).  If none of the {\em fopen\/}s succeed, then
    the {\em fopenv} function will return~a~{\small NULL} pointer.

  \item[void outofmem(void *ptr,char *fmt,...)] \     The {\em outofmem} function checks if {\em ptr} is {\small NULL}; if it is
    not, the function immediately returns.

    However, if the {\em ptr} pointer is in fact {\small NULL}, then the
    {\em fmt} and any subsequent arguments will be used like~a~regular printf
    to give~a~message to the user.  The program will then terminate.

  \item[void rdcolor(void)] \     This function reads the {\em rdcolor.dat} file, which essentially is an
    extended ``termcap'' file.  It uses the ``RDCOLOR'' environment variable with
    {\em fopenv} to search for the {\em rdcolor.dat} file.  The function uses
    that file to set up various string variables ({\small RED}, {\small CLEAR},
    -- see below).

  \item[void rdcputs(char *s,FILE *fp)] \     This function puts~a~string out to the {\small FILE} pointer {\em fp},
    except that those strings ({\small XRED}, {\small XUWHITE}, etc.) are
    interpreted using the {\em rdcolor}-provided string instead.

  \item[char *sprt(char *s)] \     This function returns~a~pointer to~a~static buffer (there are four of them).
    The string {\em s} has all of its characters made into ``visible'' forms:
    control characters become \^A through \^Z and characters with {\small ANSI}
    values greater than or equal to $128$ are made into \verb`~###` sequences.
    Characters which are normally visible are left unchanged.

  \item[void srmtrblk(char *s)] \     This function removes any trailing ``blanks'' (white space) from the
    end of~a~string.

  \item[char *stpblk(char *p)] \     This function returns~a~pointer to the first non-white space character
    in the string {\em p} (ie.~steps past blanks).

  \item[char *stpnxt(char *s,char *fmt)] \     This function returns~a~pointer to the first character in {\em s} which
    would not have been read by~a~{\em sscanf(s,fmt,...)} function.  Useful
    for quick and dirty parsing.

  \item[char *strnxtfmt(char *fmt)] \     The {\em strnxtfmt} function returns~a~pointer to the beginning of the
    (next) format code substring.  If {\em fmt} is {\small NULL}, then the
    previous format string is used (ie.~a pointer to the last {\em fmt} code
    is retained and the~a~pointer to the next format code pointer will be
    returned).  This function bears some similarity to {\small strtok} except
    that it jumps from format code to format code (used by Sscanf).

\end{description}

The {\em rdcolor.dat\/} file describes terminal escape sequences to use
to control color and~a~few other actions.  Each line which does not begin
with~a~white space character is assumed to be~a~terminal line: terminal
types are separated by vertical bars and the line is terminated by~a~colon.
There are~a~number of strings defined (see Table~\ref{rdcolor}).

\begin{table}[thb]
  \begin{center}
  \caption{rdcolor.dat strings}
  \label{rdcolor}
  \begin{tabular}{||l|l||}
