    C supports if-then-else (without a "then" :)...

        if(expr) {
            ..list-of-statements..
            }
        else if(expr) {
            ..list-of-statements..
            }
        ..repeat-as-needed..
        else {
            ..list-of-statements..
            }

    The else if(){} and else{} sections are optional.  C will
    evaluate each if-expression to see if any of them evaluate
    to not-zero; others are subsequently skipped.

    
    C supports switch-case

        switch(expr) {
        case 1:
            break;
        case '2':
            break;
        default:
            break;
            }

    The switch expression must evaluate to a char/integer/enumerated type, and
    each of the cases must be one of the same types: char/integer/enumerated
    type.  In other words,  case "abc":  isn't legal.  C will pass control
    to the matching case.  Note that unless the "break" statement is included
    C will fall through following cases.  If no case matches, the default:
    case will match.

Problem 1:

    Write a program using if-else if-else which determines what grade should
    be assigned to a score, assuming the standard grade-school standard of
    90+=A, 80-89=B, etc.

    Hints:
        int main(int argc,char **argv)
        {
        int score;
        sscanf(argv[1],"%d",&score);
        ...
        }

Problem 2:

    Modify the program above to use switch-case.

    Hints:
        int main(int argc,char **argv)
        {
        char tenscore;
        char unitscore;

        if(!strcmp("100",argv[1])) ...
        tenscore = argv[1][0];
        unitscore= argv[1][1];
        ...
        }
