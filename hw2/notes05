Loops

    C sports three types of loops:

        while(expr) {                      executes while expression evaluates
            ...                            to true (ie. not zero).
            }

        do {                               do the following statements and
            ...                            continue doing them while the
            } while(expr);                 expression evalutes to true.

        for(initialize; test; update) {    initialize expression can do several
            ...                            things  (ex. x=y=0, z=1), and will
            }                              be executed once.  Then the test
                                           expression is evaluated; if true,
                                           the main body of the loop gets
                                           executed.  Then, the update expression
                                           (which can do several things) is executed
                                           and then the test again.

    In addition, one can use break to break out of one level of loops.

    One may use "continue" to immediately jump to the (update), test, and body.

Problems:
    1) Write a program that computes 10! using a while() loop
    2) Write a program that computes 10! using a do-while() loop
    3) Write a program that computes 10! using a for() loop
